1. Upload your video in `.mp4` format.
2. Select Audio/MIDI input from the selection menu in the top-right corner.
3. If a MIDI keyboard is connected, map MIDI to pads. MIDI CC 1-7 corresponds to bookmarks’ start positions, while MIDI CC 8 modulates grain length.
4. Add bookmarks in your preferred spots in the video.
5. Adjust grain length and start position.
6. Activate “Auto Mode” for automatic control of effects, or manually control them using the left-column knobs:
    - **Top to Bottom:** Black & White, Color Inversion, Saturation, Color Gradient.
7. Adjust thresholds in the Spectrum Visualizer and set effect ratios in the FX Matrix.
8. Exit Edit Mode (`E`) and start looping grains by triggering a pad.
